HOW TO COMPILE THIS PROGRAM:
This program is licensed as an open software. The source code comes with an executable file. 
The user can run this executable file as a script called compile.sh. It is a bash script that 
compiles the program using the gcc compiler.

Compiling from source
$ ./compile.sh			---this compiles the codes and runs the program

The program functions as a normal clock, an alarm clock and a timer. The alarm clock was carefully coded to ensure that leap years were considered and that the alarm is always sounded.

You must have gnome mplayer installed in the system. This will enable you to use system command to run play the music file from bash shell.
This program was designed for educational purposes. I decided to change the meaning of sleep function slightly. I have great love for 50 cent and decided to play his music to the user.

This is an alarm clock where the sleep function is used to identify the time the user would be alerted.

You must use 24 hour clock(military time).
